## Random facts about me:
- I'm a psychologist, specialized in behavioral science! 
- I spend most of my weekends gaming.
- I write about anime and tv shows on Instagram.
- I'm way too curious sometimes, so I have to take a couple deep breaths to remind myself to learn the basics first. I'm working on it! The good thing is, as a beginner, everything seems challenging! 😅
